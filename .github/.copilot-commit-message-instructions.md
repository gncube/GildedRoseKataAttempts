# Commit Message Guidelines

When generating commit messages:

1. Use conventional commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

   - Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, style, chore
   - Scope examples: aged-brie, backstage-passes, sulfuras, conjured-items

2. First line should be a concise summary (max 72 characters)

3. For the Gilded Rose project:

   - Mention specific item types affected (Aged Brie, Backstage passes, Sulfuras, Conjured items)
   - Reference business rules when appropriate
   - Indicate test coverage for changes

4. For larger changes, include a more detailed explanation after the summary, separated by a blank line

5. Include any breaking changes or special considerations at the end

Example:

```
feat(conjured-items): implement quality degradation rules

- Added handling for Conjured items to degrade twice as fast
- Ensured quality never goes below 0
- Added tests for both in-date and expired Conjured items
```
